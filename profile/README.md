# Welcome to Interesting Technology Company 💡

> **"If you got something interesting, you are in the right place."**

We don't do boring. We build things that make life smarter, greener, and a lot more _interesting_.

---

### 👀 What We Do

We build services that change people's lives, change the world, and — most importantly — change our bank account balance. In that order. Hopefully.

### 🚀 What We Are Working On Right Now

- 🌾 **[Planty](https://planty.farm)** : Salad as a Service. Reconnecting you with nature in the concrete jungle.
- 🇨🇦 **[uhak.ca](https://uhak.ca)** : All-in-one platform for Korean students planning to study in Canada. Course roadmaps, university comparisons, and prerequisite warnings so you don't lose a year attending wrong class.
- 🔒 **LockIn** : Not another "focus helper" app. Throws tempting content at you while you study - survive and you win. Give in and it roasts you. Deposit-backed sessions, seasonal rankings, and user-created bait content included.
